# Simple Semi-Analogue Password Manager [WIP]

This is a very simple way to store passwords, it's also semi-analogue.

## How does it work?

Assuming it works, it'll be like this:

You put your e-mail/account/whatever on a piece of paper (this is the analogue part), then you upload your password to the app (I'd suggest you do it on your local machine, clone the repo and use the index when it's ready - it's not yet), and it will generate a hash, some weird string.

Then you write that hash into your piece of paper, so you have the hash and the account.

Then when you forget your password you come back to the app, select the un-hash checkbox and there you'll have it.

You can see the original code doesn't store anything and has no external connections to APIs, if anything you can take the google pre-connect thingys I used for fonts and material-icons.

DISCLAIMER: if you don't trust it don't use it, this is actually a pet project of mine, which I intend to use.
